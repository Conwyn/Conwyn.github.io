Colab Swift GDrive Service Account

Background FAST.AI provided a wonderful course in 2019 in two parts. The second part introduced Swift. 
Swift is a standard 3G language with lots of safety check to stop me making all the mistakes I normally make when learning a new language. 
Unfortunately "How do I do?" involves Google and guess.

Colab is a free resource of server with GPU from Google but you only have a fresh local drive.

Google drive  (Gdrive) is a 15GB free resource where you can store data.

FAST.AI generally uses Python. Python running on Colab allows you to connect to your Google Drive. 
GDrive Colab and Python - a great combination. 
Python invokes Gdrive authentication which invokes a data entry box into which you sign and returns a token.
You paste the token into Colab and everything is fine.

So all we need to do is write similar functionality for Swift and we have a great combination but with the power of Swift.
