    Capter 10 : NLP Deep Dive using the pretrained language model and IMDB build a classifier
    Chapter 8 : Collaborative Filtering Deep Dive using Movie Lens to create the latent factors
    From the latent factors identify the highest values per movie and download the IMDB reviews
    Assign the latent factors as multicategories to the reviews per movie
    Chapter 6: Other Computer Vision Problem - Multi-Label Classification
    Perform a classification of all the movie reviews using the Wiki-IMDB encoder and vocab
    Produce frequency analysis of the categories for all the reviews per movie
    Remove the most frequent category because of domination
