# Movies and Latent Factors
##Introduction
This blogs describes my search to understand FASTAI language classification
The the phases are as follows.
1) Capter 10 : NLP Deep Dive using the pretrained language model and IMDB build a classifier
2) Chapter 8 : Collaborative Filtering Deep Dive using Movie Lens to create the latent factors
3) From the latent factors identify the highest values per movie and download the IMDB reviews
4) Assign the latent factors as multicategories to the reviews per movie
5) Chapter 6: Other Computer Vision Problem - Multi-Label Classification
6) Perform a classification of all the movie reviews using the Wiki-IMDB encoder and vocab
7) Produce frequency analysis of the categories for all the reviews per movie
8) Remove the most frequent category because of domination
9) Produce frequency analysis of the categories for all the reviews per movie
